# Ansible playbook tasks


### Below we have selected ansible playbook tasks with brief description. 
### Variables like {{ projectId }} and {{ projectId_ver }} and others are defined in pom.xml and passed to ansible plugin during maven execution. 


#### *** Task with module copy, you need to define source folder and destination folder
``` 
- name: Copy start-node script to base image work directory
    copy:
      src:  "{{ project_basedir }}/target/dependencies/{{ platform }}.zip"
      dest: "{{ project_build_directory }}/docker/base/maven/"
```
#### *** Task with module replace and loop. This is ansible recommended method to customize config/settings/text files during the playbook execution. Removing a string from file in specific path is also available in this module.
Search is based on defined regular expressions in the list below which is executed in a loop.  
```
- name: Update dockerfile before building base image
    replace:
      path: "{{ project_build_directory }}/docker/base/Dockerfile"
      regexp: "{{ item.search }}"
      replace: "{{ item.replace }}"
    with_items:
      - { search: '(^LABEL build-image=)(.*)$', replace: "LABEL build-image={{ projectId_ver }}" }
      - { search: '(^###Note:\s)(.*)$', replace: '###Note: LABEL statement build by Ansible playbook' }
```

#### *** Task with module docker_image to build a Docker image. 
```
- name: Building SB base image - sbrt-base
    docker_image:
      build:
        path: "{{ project_build_directory }}/docker/base/"
        pull: no
      push: no
      name: sbrt-base
      repository: sbrt-base
      tag: "{{ sbrt_ver }}"
      source: build
```

#### *** Task with docker_container module. 
```
- name: Start container A.{{ projectId }}
    docker_container:
      name: A.{{ projectId }}
      image: docker/{{ projectId }}:{{ projectId_ver }}
      hostname: A.example.com
      networks:
        - name: example.com
          aliases:
            - A.example.com
      env:
        NODENAME: A.{{ projectId }}
      state: started
```

#### *** Task with shell module can execute bash commands on target. In the task below we execute docker exec â€¦ command and register the result in NodeAresults variable. After this is completed successfully, the next task displays the results on screen based on module debug.
```
- name: Run epadmin command on Node A
    shell: docker exec A.{{ projectId }} epadmin --servicename={{ projectId }} display cluster
    register: NodeAresults
    when: skipTests == 'false'
- name: Node A
    debug: var=NodeAresults.stdout_lines
```

#### *** Task with docker_container module to stop and remove container A
```
- name: Stop and remove container A
    docker_container:
      name: A.{{ projectId }}
